## What are we doing this semester?

 - I'm Nat Tuck
 - This is "Robotic Science and Systems" CS5335 / CS4610
 - Video lectures: One take no edits
 - We're going to be exploring control programs for mobile robots.
 - What makes a mobile robot?
   - Sensors, Actuators, Control Program, Autonomous Behavior
   - Mobile robot: Some actuators move the robot
 - Primarily in simulation.
   - Simulation is a great idea in general.
   - But this semester it makes even more sense, since getting teams together to
     work with physical devices is harder.
 - What kind of mobile robots?
 - Traditional wheeled teaching robots.
 - Space Ships!

## Pandemic Adaptations

 - Course structure is flipped: Online video lectures are the lectures.
 - Each week has one set of video lectures, which should be watched before
   coming to in-person meetings.
 - In-person meetings are optional, and will consist of demos and Q&A.
 - The demos will frequently be the same for the two meetings in a week.
 - In-person meetings are streamed via Zoom - you can ask questions remotely
   using Zoom chat.
 - Office hours are online using Teams.

Attending in-person meetings:

 - Wear a mask
 - Maintain social distancing
 - Arrive on time; if you're more than a couple minutes late, you may not be
   allowed in.
 - Entering and leaving will take extra time to avoid mobs at the door
 - Expect setup to take a few minutes
 - Expect meetings to end early
   - Because we need to leave time to allow for setup/teardown
   - Because we're out of Q&A questions
