## Physical Robot

 - Show the MBot Ranger
 - Focusing on this was plan A
 - With COVID-19, this is now optional.

 - One of the later HW's may optionally use the Ranger, and it's one of the
   options for the final project.
 - You don't need to decide now. It's safe to wait at least until October.
 - Overall, I recommend getting one. It's a really nice toy-style robot kit that
   has a lot of promise
