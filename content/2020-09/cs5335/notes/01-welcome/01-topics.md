## What's a robot? 

(none of this is useful)

People use the term broadly, covering everything from artifically intelligent
agents in video games to assistive exoskeletons that are basically just
hydraulic pants.

My personal definition of "robot" is more strict:

 - A robot is a machine that exists in the physical world.
 - It has sensors that let it sense the world around it.
 - It has actuators that let it interact with the world around it.
 - It's running software that can control it sufficiently to autonomously
   perform a complex physical task using the sensors and actuators.

And in this class we're going to focus on *mobile* robots, where some of the
actuators need to let the robot move around. So robot arms on assembly lines are
robots, but we're not going to talk about them.
