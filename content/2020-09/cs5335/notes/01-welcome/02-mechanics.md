## Pandemic Adaptations

 - Course structure is flipped: Online video lectures are the lectures.
 - Each week has one set of video lectures, which should be watched before
   coming to in-person meetings.
 - In-person meetings are optional, and will consist of demos and Q&A.
 - The demos will frequently be the same for the two meetings in a week.
 - In-person meetings are streamed via Zoom - you can ask questions remotely
   using Zoom chat.
 - Office hours are online using Teams.

Attending in-person meetings:

 - Wear a mask
 - Maintain social distancing
 - Arrive on time; if you're more than a couple minutes late, you may not be
   allowed in.
 - Entering and leaving will take extra time to avoid mobs at the door
 - Expect setup to take a few minutes
 - Expect meetings to end early
   - Because we need to leave time to allow for setup/teardown
   - Because we're out of Q&A questions
