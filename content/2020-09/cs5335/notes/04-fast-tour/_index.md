## Planning

Finding a fast planetary tour is a planning or routing problem, but it's
a bit different from the traditional examples.

Common plan is to reduce the problem to a discrete graph, then search the graph
for an appropriate solution.

Examples:

 - Solving a maze
 - Backing up a car
 - 2D version of the moon tour issue
