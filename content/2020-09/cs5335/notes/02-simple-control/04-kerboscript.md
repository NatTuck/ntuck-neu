# How to Script a Rocket Launch

In order to write control programs for our KSP spacecraft, we'll be using the
KOS mod and its built in scripting language KerboScript.

KerboScript was designed explicitly to *look* like an awful language from the
1970's. It's definitely inspired by COBOL and BASIC. But it helps illustrate a
couple of useful points: all software is written with constraints, and that
sometimes includes using a programming language (like KerboScript, or PHP, or
Ada) which must have been designed just to troll you.

To learn KOS and KerboScript, you'll want to:

 - Keep in mind that KerboScript is a reasonably typical modern dynamic lanugae
   (like Lua, JavaScript, or Python) under the ugly syntax.
 - Do the Quick Start Tutorial
 - Skim the full docs. They aren't that long.
