# Project Presentation Q&A

 - Last two classes are presentation Q&A
 - Schedule is posted on Piazza
 - Watch presentation before scheduled Q&A day; watch the demo if you
   want to see it to understand the project better

# What we did this semester

This class was a series of homework assignments followed by a project.

The first two assignments we introduced the simulation tools we used:

 - HW01 introduced Gazebo. You controlled a robot avoiding simple obstacles and
   driving to a goal.
 - HW02 introduced Kerbal Space Program. You wrote a script which launched a
   rocket to orbit.

Then we had two more KSP assignments:
   
 - In HW03, you landed a rocket on the Mun.
 - In HW04, you explored planning inter-moon transfers.

Then four assignments solving mazes with a wheeled robot in Gazebo.

 - In HW05, we started work on solving mazes.
 - HW06 involved building an occupancy grid map.
 - HW07 did pathfinding on the map
 - HW08 added a camera and required image processign.

Final project:

 - Lots of Gazebo simulations and dead batteries.

# Median Grades

 - HW01: 2/2
 - HW02: 2/2
 - HW03: 2/2
 - HW04: 1/2
 - HW05: 2/2
 - HW06: 1/2
 - HW07: 1/2
 - HW08: 1/2

Adding those up, we get 4 missed points, which would mean a student who got the
median on every HW would get a B+. We'll see how project grades do, but I intend
to issue a higher median grade than B+.

# Do your TRACE evals

 - What went well?
 - What went poorly?
