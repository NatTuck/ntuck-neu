Fall 2020

**This is an EARLY draft. Information subject to change.**

The course catalog says:

Introduces autonomous mobile robots with a focus on algorithms and software
development, including closed-loop control, robot software architecture, wheeled
locomotion and navigation, tactile and basic visual sensing, obstacle detection
and avoidance, and grasping and manipulation of objects. Offers students an
opportunity to progressively construct mobile robots from a predesigned
electromechanical kit. The robots are controlled wirelessly by software of the
students’ own design, built within a provided robotics software framework.
Culminates in a project that connects the algorithms and hardware developed in
the course with a selected topic in the current robotics research literature.

## Required Materials

(DRAFT, don't buy anything)

 - Kerbal Space Program on Steam
 - A Robot Kit

## Tasks and Grading

 - Completing tasks gets you points.
 - Each task is worth some number of points.
 - Some tasks are extra credit, which don't count towards the total number of
   points offered.

Final grades:

 - If you get all the regular points, you get an A.
 - Every two points missed reduces your grade by one level (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C, D, F)

To be clear:

 - If you don't submit anything, you get no points.
 - If it doesn't work, you get no points.
 - If it's not excellent, you lose a point.

## Tasks

(DRAFT, don't buy anything)

 - Homeworks: 3-4 of them, 10 points each
 - Small Projects: 2-3 of them, 2 points each
 - Final Project:
   - Proposal, 2 points
   - Functionality, 4 points
   - Presentation, 2 points

### Late Work

Work submitted late is worth one point less.

Work submitted more than 48 hours late, or submitted late on or after December
1st, will not be accepted for credit.

**Late Registration**

If you register late for the course please contact the professor for extended
homework due dates as soon as possible. In general you will be expected to
complete all of your assignments in order, and you will recieve an extension on
at most one assignment due after your registration date.

Late submissions will be penalized per the normal policy without an explicit
written extension from the instructor.

### Participation

 - Participating on Piazza and Teams is a task worth two points.
 - Excellent participation means asking good questions, providing good answers,
   and actively participating in discussion in the Teams General channel.

## Policies

### Contesting Grades

Grades are mostly deterministic in this class:

 - Did you do it?
 - Was it submitted on time?
 - Does it work?
 - Is there major stuff wrong with it such that it should lose a point for being "mediocre"?

If you think you have an incorrectly assigned grade:

 - Send a written appeal letter to your grading TA explaining why you think your
   grade is incorrect and requesting it be changed.
 - Your TA will respond either by changing the grade or sending a written denial.
 - If you get a written denial, you can forward your appeal letter, the denial,
   and a denial appeal letter to the instructor with an explaintion of a concrete
   factual mistake that the TA has made in grading.
 - If your grade is clearly and factually wrong, it will be changed. If the
   issue is in any way unclear, the grade will not be changed.

Whether or not your final project was "excellent" is a subjective judgement by
the course staff and cannot be appealed.

If you misunderstood the instructions and failed to complete a portion of a
homework assignment your grading TA may, at their option, allow you to fix it
either when the submission is graded or if you request the opportunity to do so.
TAs probably will accept the first such request, and probably will not accept
the third for a given student this semester.

### Special Accomodations

Students needing disability accommodations should visit the [Disability Resource
Center](http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/about-the-drc/) (DRC).

If you have been granted special accomodations either through the DRC or as a
student athlete, let me know as soon as possible.

### Code Copying &amp; Collabaration Policy

FIXME: Writing libraries. point?

Copying code and submitting it without proper attribution is strictly prohibited
in this class. This is plagiarism, which is a serious violation of academic
integrity.

Providing solution code to other students is also strictly prohibited.

**Details**

 - For solo assignments, you should personally write your code either from
   scratch or using only the starter code provided in the assignment.
 - For team assignments, your team should do the same.

**Lecture Notes**

Lecture notes are *not* starter code, and should not be copied without
attribution. As long as attribution is provided, there is no penalty for using
code from the lecture notes.

**Collaboration and Attribution**

Since it's not plagiarism if you provide attribution, as a special exception
to these rules, any code sharing with attribution will not be treated as a
major offense.

There is no penalty for copying small snippets of code (a couple of lines) with
attribution as long as this code doesn't significantly impact the intended
challenge of the assignment. This should be in a comment above these lines
clearly indicating the source (including author name and URL, if any).

If you copy a large amount of code with attribution, you won't recieve credit
for having completed that portion of the assignment, but there will be no further
penalty. The attribution must be obvious and clearly indicate both which code it
applies to and where it came from.

**Posting Code on the Web**

You may post code written for this class publically on the web as long as:

 * You clearly specify that you are the author and when the code was written.
 * You provide clear attribution for any external code.
 * You note that your code was written for this class, including which
   assignment the code was written for.

**Penalty for Plagarism or Providing Solution Code**

First offense:

 - You get an F in the course.
 - You will be reported to OSCCR and CCIS.

Avoid copying code if you can. If you're looking at an example, understand what
it does, type something similar that is appropriate to your program, and provide
attribution. If you must copy code, put in the attribution immediately, every
time or you will fail the course over what feels like a minor mistake.
