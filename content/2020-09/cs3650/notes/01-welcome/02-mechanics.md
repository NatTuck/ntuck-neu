   - If you get stuck, you can ask questions here.
   - You shouldn't generally post code.
   - Not for direct messages to course staff: use email or possibly
     a Teams DM.
 - Teams
   - Use general chat.
 - AMD64 hints links
 - Inkfish
 - Office Hours start next Monday.

## Pandemic Adaptions

 - Course structure is flipped: Online video lectures are the lectures.
 - Each week has one set of video lectures, which should be watched before
   coming to in-person meetings.
 - In-person meetings are optional, and will consist of demos and Q&A.
 - The demos will frequently be the same for the two meetings in a week.
 - In-person meetings are streamed via Zoom - you can ask questions remotely
   using Zoom chat.
 - Office hours are online using Teams.

Attending in-person meetings:

 - Wear a mask
 - Maintain social distancing
 - Arrive on time; if you're more than a couple minutes late, you may not be
   allowed in.
 - Entering and leaving will take extra time to avoid mobs at the door
 - Expect setup to take a few minutes
 - Expect meetings to end early
   - Because we need to leave time to allow for setup/teardown
   - Because we're out of Q&A questions

## Syllabus

 - There's a schedule. It may resemble what happens.
 - Grades: Assignments.
 - Homework: These are difficult programming assignments.
 - Challenges: These are very difficult programming assignments that you are not
   expected to get 100% on.
 - You are expected to get stuck on assignments. Leave time to get unstuck. Plan
   on getting stuck twice on a HW and five times on each challenge.

Cheating

 - Copying code without clear, written attribution is plagarism.
 - If you submit plagarized work, you fail the course.
 - You're not allowed to share solution code with other students either.
 - If you cheat, you get reported to the college, which is bad.
 - You are given starter code for assignments, you can use that.
 
 - There is code shown in lecture. It's not starter code, so using
   it without attribution is plagarism. This is the one case where I
   might be lenient on the policy, but I also may just give you an
   F for the semester on the first offense.

The best way to avoid cheating (and the best way to learn the content
in this course), is to personally type your own code. Don't download
other people's solutions, don't copy and paste other people's code, etc.
